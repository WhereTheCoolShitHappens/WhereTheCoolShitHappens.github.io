This site is maintained by a number of techies playing with the latest technologies and toys...

We store all the source code we create at: [github](https://github.com/WhereTheCoolShitHappens)

And of course we have a slack workspace: [slack](https://wtcsh.slack.com). You can join slack [here](https://wtcsh-slack.herokuapp.com)

New vlogs and blogs will be added as we continue our journey.
